        Transforms allow you to modify the visual appearance of an element by
        rotating, scaling, skewing, or translating it. You can use transforms to
        create visual effects such as hover effects, 3D effects, and parallax
        scrolling. Transforms are created using the transform property, which
        takes a function such as rotate, scale, skew, or translate as its value.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of how you can use Transforms:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Rotate: You can use the rotate function to rotate an element around
            its center point. For example, to rotate an element 45 degrees
            clockwise, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Scale: You can use the scale function to change the size of an
            element. For example, to scale an element to 200% of its original
            size, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  transform: scale(2);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Skew: You can use the skew function to tilt an element along the
            x-axis or y-axis. For example, to skew an element 45 degrees along
            the x-axis, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  transform: skewX(45deg);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Translate: You can use the translate function to move an element
            along the x-axis or y-axis. For example, to translate an element 50
            pixels along the x-axis, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  transform: translateX(50px);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiple transforms: You can use multiple transform functions in a
            single transform property to create more complex effects. For
            example, to rotate, scale, and translate an element all at once, you
            can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  transform: rotate(45deg) scale(1.5) translateX(50px);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of how you can use Transforms to modify
        the visual appearance of elements. With a little bit of practice and
        experimentation, you can master these techniques and create some truly
        impressive effects.
