        Webpack is a popular front-end build tool that is used to compile and
        bundle JavaScript, CSS, and other assets into a single file or multiple
        files for use in a web application. The program comes in two versions,
        Webpack 4 and Webpack 5, each of which has unique features and upgrades.
        In this article, we'll contrast Webpack 4 and 5 and point out their key
        differences.
    </p>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    <p>Webpack 4 and 5 can be installed using npm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
npm install webpack@4
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-bash">
npm install webpack@5
</code></pre>
    <h3>Performance</h3>
    <p>
        Performance is one of the largest differences between Webpack 4 and 5.
        The build speeds and memory use of Webpack 5 have been improved, making
        it faster than Webpack 4. In some circumstances, Webpack 5 has a build
        time that is up to 98% faster than Webpack 4, making it a significant
        improvement.
    </p>
    <h3>Code splitting</h3>
    <p>
        Webpack 5 introduced a new code splitting mechanism, which is a feature
        that allows you to split your code into smaller chunks and load them on
        demand, instead of loading everything at once. This results in faster
        load times and improved performance. Webpack 5 has improved code
        splitting compared to Webpack 4, making it easier to split your code
        into smaller chunks and load them as needed.
    </p>
    <h3>ESM support</h3>
    <p>
        Webpack 5 added support for ECMAScript modules (ESM), a contemporary
        approach to constructing JavaScript modules. ESM is completely supported
        by contemporary browsers and enables you to write JavaScript code in a
        more condensed and maintainable manner. ESM support in Webpack 5 makes
        it simpler to write contemporary JavaScript code out of the box.
    </p>
    <h3>Loaders and Plugins</h3>
    <p>
        Webpack loaders and plugins are crucial since they let you expand its
        functionality and work with a variety of different file types and
        content. Due to differences in compatibility and requirements, Webpack 5
        may not be compatible with loaders and plugins designed for Webpack 4.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here's a summary of some common loaders and plugins and whether they
        work with Webpack 4 and 5:
    </p>
    <h4>Loaders</h4>
    <ul>

            <p>
                <span class="inline-code">babel-loader</span>: Compiles modern
                JavaScript code into backwards-compatible code that can run in
                older browsers. This loader works with both Webpack 4 and 5.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>

        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="inline-code">file-loader</span>: Copies files from
                your project into the output directory. This loader works with
                both Webpack 4 and 5.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="inline-code">url-loader</span>: Loads files as URLs
                and can automatically convert them to data URLs if they are
                smaller than a specified limit. This loader works with both
                Webpack 4 and 5.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Plugins</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="inline-code">html-webpack-plugin</span>: Generates
                an HTML file for your web application, based on a template. This
                plugin works with both Webpack 4 and 5.

        </li>

                files from your project into the output directory. This plugin
                works with both Webpack 4 and 5.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="inline-code">mini-css-extract-plugin</span>:
                Extracts CSS files into separate files instead of including them
                in the JavaScript bundle. This plugin works with both Webpack 4
                and 5.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <span class="inline-code">uglifyjs-webpack-plugin</span>:

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It's always a good idea to check the compatibility of your loaders and
        plugins before upgrading to a new version of Webpack. In most cases,
        it's easy to update them to work with Webpack 5, but it's always better
        to be safe than sorry.
    </p>
    <p>
        In general, Webpack 5 is compatible with most loaders and plugins, but
        some may need to be updated to work with the new version. If you
        encounter any compatibility issues, it's always a good idea to check the
        plugin's documentation or seek help from the community.
    </p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Webpack 5 is a significant improvement over Webpack 4, offering faster
        build times, improved memory usage, better code splitting, and support
        for ESM. If you're already using Webpack 4, upgrading to Webpack 5 is a
        no-brainer, as you will see immediate improvements in performance and
        new features. If you're new to Webpack, it's a great choice for your
        front-end build tool, as it provides all the features you need to
        compile and bundle your assets.
