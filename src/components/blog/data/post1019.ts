        Filters allow you to apply visual effects to an element, such as
        blurring, grayscale, or color shifting. You can use filters to create
        special effects or to enhance the visual appearance of an element.
        Filters are created using the filter property, which takes a function
        such as blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, or hue-rotate as its
        value.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of how you can use Filters:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Blur: You can use the blur function to blur an element. For example,
            to blur an element 5 pixels, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  filter: blur(5px);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Brightness: You can use the brightness function to adjust the
            overall brightness of an element. For example, to increase the
            brightness of an element by 50%, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  filter: brightness(150%);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Contrast: You can use the contrast function to adjust the overall
            contrast of an element. For example, to increase the contrast of an
            element by 50%, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  filter: contrast(150%);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Grayscale: You can use the grayscale function to convert an element
            to grayscale. For example, to convert an element to 100% grayscale,
            you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  filter: grayscale(100%);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Hue-rotate: You can use the hue-rotate function to shift the hue of
            an element. For example, to shift the hue of an element 180 degrees,
            you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element {
  filter: hue-rotate(180deg);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of how you can use Filters to apply visual
        effects to elements. With a little bit of practice and experimentation,
        you can master these techniques and create some truly impressive
        effects.
