        Animations allow you to add motion and interaction to your web pages.
        You can use CSS animations to create smooth transitions between
        different states, or to create complex interactions that involve
        multiple elements. CSS animations are created using the @keyframes rule,
        which defines the animation and specifies the changes to be made to the
        element's style at different points in the animation. You can then use
        the animation property to specify the duration, timing, and other
        aspects of the animation.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of how you can use Animations:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Simple animation: You can create a simple animation by defining a
            @keyframes rule that specifies the changes to be made to the
            element's style over time, and then using the animation property to
            specify the duration, timing, and other aspects of the animation.
            For example, to create a simple fade-in animation that lasts 2
            seconds, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.element {
  animation: fade-in 2s;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiple keyframes: You can create more complex animations by
            defining multiple keyframes in your @keyframes rule. For example, to
            create an animation that scales an element up and then down over the
            course of 2 seconds, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes scale {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.5);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
}

.element {
  animation: scale 2s;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Animation timing: You can use the animation-timing-function property
            to control the timing of the animation. For example, to create an
            animation that starts slowly and then speeds up, you can use the
            following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes slide-left {
  from {
    transform: translateX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(-100%);
  }
}

.element {
  animation: slide-left 2s ease-in;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Animation delay: You can use the animation-delay property to specify
            a delay before the animation begins. For example, to create an
            animation that starts 2 seconds after the element is hovered over,
            you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes pulse {
  0% {
    transform: scale(1);
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
  }
}

.element:hover {
  animation: pulse 1s;
  animation-delay: 2s;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Animation iteration: You can use the animation-iteration-count
            property to specify the number of times the animation should be
            played. For example, to create an animation that repeats
            indefinitely, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
@keyframes spin {
  from {
    transform: rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    transform: rotate(360deg);
  }
}

.element {
  animation: spin 2s linear infinite;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of how you can use Animations to add
        motion and interaction to your web pages. With a little bit
