        There are several ways to asynchronously load and execute ECMAScript
        (ES) modules in Angular. In this tutorial, we'll look at three of the
        most common methods:

                Lazy Loading with the Angular Router: One of the easiest and
                most straightforward ways to asynchronously load modules in
                Angular is to use the built-in lazy loading feature of the
                Angular Router. With this approach, you can configure specific
                routes to be loaded on demand, rather than all at once when the
                application is first loaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use lazy loading, you need to configure specific routes to be
                loaded on demand by setting the
                <span class="inline-code">loadChildren</span> property of the
                route configuration to the path of the module you want to load,
                preceded by the string "path/to/module#ModuleName".
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, if you have a module called
                <span class="inline-code">MyModule</span> located in a file
                called <span class="inline-code">my.module.ts</span>, you would
                configure the route like this:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
{
    path: 'my',
    loadChildren: './my.module#MyModule'
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                When the router navigates to the
                <span class="inline-code">/my</span> route, it will load the
                <span class="inline-code">MyModule</span> module asynchronously.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also good to note that you can use the
                <span class="inline-code"
                    >preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules</span
                >
                property to preload all the lazy load modules:
            </p>
                <pre><code>
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterModule, Routes, PreloadAllModules } from '@angular/router';

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch: 'full' },
  { path: 'home', loadChildren: './home/home.module#HomeModule' },
  { path: 'about', loadChildren: './about/about.module#AboutModule' },
  { path: 'contact', loadChildren: './contact/contact.module#ContactModule' },
];

@NgModule({
  imports: [RouterModule.forRoot(routes, { preloadingStrategy: PreloadAllModules })],
  exports: [RouterModule]
})
export class AppRoutingModule { }
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    In this example, all the routes configured to be lazy load
                    using the <span class="inline-code">loadChildren</span> property, will be
                    preloaded as soon as the application starts. This means that
                    when the user navigates to one of these routes, the
                    corresponding module will be loaded almost instantly,
                    resulting in a faster overall user experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This strategy is useful when we have a small set of routes
                    and the user is likely to navigate to all of them, also we
                    can set a high value for the <span class="inline-code">data</span> property of
                    the route and only preload the one that are set to be
                    preloaded
                </p>
                <pre><code>
{ path: 'about', loadChildren: './about/about.module#AboutModule', data: { preload: true } },
</code></pre>
                <p>
                    It's important to note that preloading all modules may take
                    longer at startup and also it increases the memory
                    consumption, but it could give better performance when the
                    user navigates between the routes of the application.

                Dynamic Imports: The ECMAScript (ES) 6 standard introduced the
                <span class="inline-code">import()</span> statement, which
                allows you to asynchronously load modules at runtime. Angular
                provides a way to use this feature by including the
                <span class="inline-code">import()</span> call inside an
                <span class="inline-code">async</span> function that returns a
                <span class="inline-code">Promise</span>. You can then use the
                <span class="inline-code">await</span> keyword to wait for the
                module to be loaded before using it. This allows you to load the
                module when you need it, rather than all at once when the
                application is first loaded.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, to asynchronously load
                <span class="inline-code">MyModule</span>, you would use the
                following code:
            </p>
            <h4>Step 1: Create a module loader service</h4>
            <p>
                Create a <span class="inline-code">ModuleLoaderService</span> to
                use dynamic imports:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class ModuleLoaderService {
  constructor() {}

  async load(path: string) {
    const module = await import(path);
    return module.default;
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                The <span class="inline-code">import</span> function is a
                built-in TypeScript function that dynamically imports a module
                and returns a promise that resolves to the module. The
                <span class="inline-code">.default</span> property is used to
                access the default export of the module.
            </p>
            <h4>
                Step 2: Use the module loader service to load modules on demand
            </h4>
            <p>
                Now you can use the updated
                <span class="inline-code">ModuleLoaderService</span> to
                asynchronously load modules on demand in your Angular components
                or services. Here's an example of how to use the
                <span class="inline-code">ModuleLoaderService</span> to load a
                module in an Angular component:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { ModuleLoaderService } from './module-loader.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor(private moduleLoader: ModuleLoaderService) {}

  async ngOnInit() {
    const module = await this.moduleLoader.load('/path/to/module.js');
    // Use the module here
  }
}
</code></pre>
            <p>
                In this example, the
                <span class="inline-code">ModuleLoaderService</span> is injected
                into the <span class="inline-code">AppComponent</span> and the
                <span class="inline-code">load</span> method is called in the
                <span class="inline-code">ngOnInit</span> lifecycle hook to
                asynchronously load the module. The module's default export is
                then stored in the
                <span class="inline-code">module</span> variable, which you can
                use in the component.
            </p>
            <p>
                This allows you to load the module only when you need it, rather
                than all at once when the application is first loaded.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Third-Party Libraries: There are several third-party libraries
                available that can be used to asynchronously load modules in
                Angular. One popular library is
                <span class="inline-code">@ngx-dynamic-components/core</span>,
                which provides a simple way to load and unload components
                dynamically in Angular. Another popular library is
                <span class="inline-code">ngx-loadable-component</span> which
                allows you to load a component on demand, and it also provides
                some additional features such as showing a loading spinner while
                the component is loading. To use
                <span class="inline-code">@ngx-dynamic-components/core</span>,
                you need to install it using npm
            </p>
            <pre><code>
npm install @ngx-dynamic-components/core
</code></pre>
            <p>
                and then import it in your module and use it to load your
                component.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import { DynamicComponentLoaderModule } from '@ngx-dynamic-components/core';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    DynamicComponentLoaderModule
  ]
})
export class MyModule { }
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Another popular library is
                <span class="inline-code">ngx-loadable-component</span>, which
                allows you to load a component on demand, and it also provides
                some additional features such as showing a loading spinner while
                the component is loading.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
npm install ngx-loadable-component
</code></pre>
            <p>
                The usage is similar to the previous library, you import it and
                use it to load your component.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
import { LoadableModule } from 'ngx-loadable-component';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    LoadableModule.forRoot()
  ]
})
export class MyModule { }
</code></pre>
            <p>
                Each of the above libraries has its advantages and
                disadvantages, and the best solution will depend on your
                specific use case and requirements. It's good to note that using
                third-party libraries may require some additional setup and
                configuration and could make your application harder to
                maintain.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Note that Lazy loading is the recommended solution from Angular, as it
        offer a great developer experience and allows for a more optimized
        application.
    </p>
    <p>You can choose the method that best fits your needs and use case.</p>
