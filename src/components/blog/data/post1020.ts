        Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements allow you to apply styles to elements
        based on their state or position within the document. Pseudo-classes are
        used to style elements based on their state, such as when an element is
        hovered over or selected. Pseudo-elements are used to style elements
        based on their position within the document, such as the first letter or
        first line of a paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of pseudo-classes:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Link pseudo-classes: You can use the :link, :visited, :hover,
            :active, and :focus pseudo-classes to style links based on their
            state. For example, to change the color of a link when it is hovered
            over, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
a:hover {
  color: blue;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            :hover: You can use the :hover pseudo-class to apply styles to an
            element when it is hovered over with the mouse. For example, to
            change the background color of an element when it is hovered over,
            you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element:hover {
  background-color: red;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            :active: You can use the :active pseudo-class to apply styles to an
            element when it is being actively clicked or pressed. For example,
            to change the font size of an element when it is being clicked, you
            can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.element:active {
  font-size: 20px;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            :focus: You can use the :focus pseudo-class to apply styles to an
            element when it has focus, such as when it is selected or tabbed to.
            For example, to change the outline color of an input field when it
            has focus, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
input:focus {
  outline-color: blue;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Form element pseudo-classes: You can use the :enabled, :disabled,
            :checked, and :required pseudo-classes to style form elements based
            on their state. For example, to change the background color of a
            checked checkbox, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
input[type="checkbox"]:checked {
  background-color: yellow;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            First and last child pseudo-classes: You can use the :first-child
            and :last-child pseudo-classes to select the first or last child
            element of a parent. For example, to change the font size of the
            first list item in an unordered list, you can use the following
            code:
<pre><code>
ul li:first-child {
  font-size: larger;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here are some examples of how you can use Pseudo-elements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            ::before: You can use the ::before pseudo-element to insert content
            before an element. For example, to insert an image before the first
            paragraph of a document, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
p::before {
  content: url(image.jpg);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            ::after: You can use the ::after pseudo-element to insert content
            after an element. For example, to insert a copyright symbol after
            the last paragraph of a document, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
p::after {
  content: "Â©";
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            ::first-letter: You can use the ::first-letter pseudo-element to
            style the first letter of an element. For example, to make the first
            letter of a paragraph larger and bold, you can use the following
            code:
<pre><code>
p::first-letter {
  font-size: 20px;
  font-weight: bold;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            ::first-line: You can use the ::first-line pseudo-element to style
            the first line of an element. For example, to make the first line of
            a paragraph italic, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
p::first-line {
  font-style: italic;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of how you can use Pseudo-classes and
        Pseudo-elements to style elements based on their state or position
        within the document. With a little bit of practice and experimentation,
        you can master these techniques and create some truly impressive
        designs.
