        Grid is a layout module that allows you to create complex, responsive,
        and flexible layouts using a two-dimensional grid system. It works by
        dividing the available space into rows and columns, and then placing
        elements into the grid using grid lines. Grid allows you to position
        elements using grid lines, control element sizes using grid tracks, and
        align elements using grid cells.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of how you can use Grid:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Define a grid: You can use the display: grid; property to define a
            grid container, and then use the grid-template-rows and
            grid-template-columns properties to define the number of rows and
            columns in the grid. For example, to create a grid with three rows
            and three columns, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Place items: You can use the grid-row and grid-column properties to
            place items into specific rows and columns in the grid. For example,
            to place an item into the first row and second column of the grid,
            you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.item {
  grid-row: 1;
  grid-column: 2;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Span items: You can use the grid-row-span and grid-column-span
            properties to make an item span multiple rows or columns. For
            example, to make an item span the first two rows of the grid, you
            can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.item {
  grid-row-span: 2;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Align and justify items: You can use the align-items and
            justify-items properties to align and justify items within their
            grid cells. For example, to align items vertically in the center of
            their cells, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.container {
  align-items: center;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Auto-fit and auto-fill: You can use the repeat function with the
            auto-fit or auto-fill keywords to create a grid that adjusts to the
            available space. For example, to create a grid that adjusts to the
            available width, you can use the following code:
<pre><code>
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(150px, 1fr));
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of how you can use Grid to create complex,
        responsive, and flexible layouts. With a little bit of practice and
        experimentation, you can master these techniques and create some truly
        impressive designs.
