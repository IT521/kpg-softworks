        <strong>Micro frontends</strong> is an architectural pattern that allows
        developers to break down a large, monolithic web application into
        smaller, more manageable chunks called "micro frontends". These micro
        frontends can be developed and deployed independently, which allows
        teams to work on different parts of the application concurrently and
        reduces the risk of conflicts when merging code.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this tutorial, we will go over how to use micro frontends to
        architect a web application.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1: Identify the components of your web application</h3>
    <p>
        The first step in using micro frontends is to identify the different
        components of your web application. These components could be features,
        modules, or pages, and they should be relatively self-contained and have
        a clear purpose. For example, a component could be a shopping cart, a
        dashboard, or a login page.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's important to note that each component should be small enough to be
        developed and deployed independently, but not so small that it becomes
        impractical to manage.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Create a micro frontend for each component</h3>
    <p>
        Once you have identified the components of your web application, the
        next step is to create a micro frontend for each one. A micro frontend
        is essentially a self-contained piece of the application that includes
        all of the code, assets, and dependencies required to run that
        component.
    </p>
    <p>
        To create a micro frontend, you will need to create a new codebase for
        each component, either by creating a new repository or by creating a new
        directory within an existing repository. Each micro frontend should
        include all of the necessary code, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as
        well as any dependencies and assets required to run the component.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Integrate the micro frontends into your web application</h3>
    <p>
        Once you have created the micro frontends for each component of your web
        application, the next step is to integrate them into the main
        application. There are several ways to do this, each with its own pros
        and cons.
    </p>
    <h4>Iframe</h4>
    <p>
        One option is to use an iframe to load each micro frontend into the main
        web application. An iframe is an HTML element that allows you to embed
        another HTML document within the current document. To use an iframe to
        load a micro frontend, you would create an iframe element in the main
        web application and set the
        <span class="inline-code">src</span> attribute to the URL of the micro
        frontend.
    </p>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allows you to load each micro frontend independently</li>
        <li>Easy to implement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be slower and less performant than other options</li>
        <li>
            Limited ability to interact with the main web application and other
            micro frontends
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Server-side rendering</h4>
    <p>
        Another option is to use server-side rendering to render each micro
        frontend on the server and serve it to the client as a complete page.
        This involves setting up a server-side application to handle the
        rendering of each micro frontend and integrating it into the main web
        application.
    </p>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Can be more performant than using iframes</li>
        <li>
            Allows you to render the micro frontend on the server and send the
            complete page to the client, which can improve the user experience
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires more setup and can be more complex to implement</li>
        <li>
            Can be slower than client-side rendering if the server-side
            application has to perform a lot of processing to render the micro
            frontend
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Client-side rendering</h4>
    <p>
        A third option is to use client-side rendering to load each micro
        frontend into the main web application via JavaScript. This involves
        using JavaScript to asynchronously load the micro frontend into the main
        web application and render it on the client.
    </p>
    <p>Pros:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Allows you to load each micro frontend asynchronously, which can
            improve the performance of your application
        </li>
        <li>
            Allows for more flexibility and interaction between the main web
            application and the micro frontends
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Cons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Requires more setup and can be more complex to implement</li>
        <li>
            Can be slower if the client-side application has to perform a lot of
            processing to render the micro frontend
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When deciding which option to use, it's important to consider the
        specific needs and requirements of your web application, as well as the
        trade-offs between performance, complexity, and flexibility.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4: Deploy and manage the micro frontends</h3>
    <p>
        Once you have integrated the micro frontends into your web application,
        the next step is to deploy and manage them. This involves setting up a
        process to build, test, and deploy each micro frontend, as well as
        monitoring and logging to track the health and performance of each micro
        frontend.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here are some best practices for deploying and managing micro frontends:
    </p>
    <h4>Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline</h4>
    <p>
        A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that handle the build,
        test, and deployment of your micro frontends. A CI/CD pipeline can help
        ensure that your micro frontends are deployed consistently and reliably,
        and can also help speed up the development and release process.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set up a CI/CD pipeline for your micro frontends, you will need to
        choose a CI/CD tool (such as Jenkins, GitLab CI, or Azure DevOps) and
        configure it to build, test, and deploy your micro frontends. This may
        involve setting up build and test scripts, creating deployment
        environments, and configuring continuous integration and deployment
        triggers.
    </p>
    <h4>Monitoring and logging</h4>
    <p>
        Monitoring and logging are essential for tracking the health and
        performance of your micro frontends. Monitoring involves tracking key
        metrics (such as response time, error rates, and resource usage) and
        alerting on any issues or anomalies. Logging involves capturing detailed
        information about the runtime behavior of your micro frontends, such as
        requests and responses, errors, and performance data.
    </p>
    <p>
        To set up monitoring and logging for your micro frontends, you will need
        to choose a monitoring and logging tool (such as New Relic, Splunk, or
        Elastic Stack) and configure it to track the metrics and events that are
        relevant to your micro frontends.
    </p>
    <h4>Dependency management</h4>
    <p>
        Dependency management is the process of managing the external libraries
        and tools that your micro frontends depend on. This can involve
        specifying the dependencies in a configuration file (such as a
        <span class="inline-code">package.json</span> file for Node.js
        projects), installing the dependencies using a package manager (such as
        npm or yarn), and updating the dependencies as needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        To manage dependencies effectively, it's important to use a version
        control system (such as Git) to track changes to the dependencies, as
        well as a package management system (such as npm or yarn) to manage the
        installation and updating of the dependencies.
    </p>
    <h4>Versioning</h4>
    <p>
        Versioning is the process of tracking and managing changes to your micro
        frontends. This can involve using a version control system (such as Git)
        to track changes to the code, as well as using a versioning scheme (such
        as semantic versioning) to track and communicate the changes to users
        and other stakeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using a versioning system, you can more easily track and manage
        changes to your micro frontends, as well as roll back to previous
        versions if necessary. It can also help you communicate changes to users
        and other stakeholders, and can make it easier to identify and resolve
        conflicts when merging code.
    </p>
    <h4>Use a containerization platform</h4>
    <p>
        Using a containerization platform (such as Docker) can make it easier to
        deploy and manage your micro frontends. A containerization platform
        allows you to package your micro frontend, along with all of its
        dependencies and assets, into a lightweight container that can be easily
        deployed and run on any platform. This can help reduce the risk of
        conflicts and compatibility issues when deploying your micro frontends.
    </p>
    <h4>Use a service mesh</h4>
    <p>
        A service mesh is a network of microservices that manage the
        communication and interactions between your micro frontends. A service
        mesh can help you route traffic between your micro frontends, manage the
        load on each micro frontend, and monitor the health and performance of
        your micro frontends. Using a service mesh can help you more easily
        deploy and manage your micro frontends, as well as improve the
        performance and reliability of your application.
    </p>
    <h4>Use a feature flagging system</h4>
    <p>
        A feature flagging system is a tool that allows you to toggle the
        visibility and functionality of certain features or micro frontends in
        your application. Using a feature flagging system can help you safely
        roll out new features or micro frontends to a subset of users, and can
        also allow you to quickly disable or roll back features if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
        By using these best practices, you can more effectively deploy and
        manage your micro frontends and improve the reliability and performance
        of your web application.
    </p>
