        Flexbox is a layout module that allows you to create flexible and
        responsive layouts easily. It works by defining a flexible container
        (called a flex container) and then distributing its child elements
        (called flex items) either horizontally or vertically within the
        container. Flexbox allows you to align and distribute items, stretch and
        shrink items, and change the order of items, all without using float or
        position properties.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some examples of how you can use Flexbox:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Align items: You can use the align-items property to align flex
            items along the cross axis (i.e., the axis perpendicular to the main
            axis). For example, to align flex items vertically in the center of
            the container, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Justify content: You can use the justify-content property to
            distribute flex items along the main axis (i.e., the axis defined by
            the flex-direction property). For example, to distribute flex items
            evenly within the container, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Flex wrap: You can use the flex-wrap property to control how flex
            items are wrapped within the container. For example, to allow flex
            items to wrap onto multiple lines if necessary, you can use the
            following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Flex grow and shrink: You can use the flex-grow and flex-shrink
            properties to control how flex items stretch or shrink to fill the
            available space. For example, to allow flex items to grow or shrink
            equally to fill the available space, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
.item {
  flex-grow: 1;
  flex-shrink: 1;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            Flex basis: You can use the flex-basis property to control the
            initial size of a flex item. For example, to set the initial size of
            a flex item to 50 pixels, you can use the following code:
<pre><code class="language-css">
.item {
  flex-basis: 50px;
}
</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These are just a few examples of how you can use Flexbox to create
        flexible and responsive layouts. With a little bit of practice and
        experimentation, you can master these techniques and create some truly
        impressive designs.
